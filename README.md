2048-heuristic
==============

This is an attempt to create a solver for the 2048 game at http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ using Scala.

The live demo can be accessed at http://aero-z.github.io/2048-heuristic/.

Current status: there is a heuristic working but it is not very smart. A human player will perform much better. The main point of this project was to try out Scala.js. This project is now paused.
